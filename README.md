- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @prniii
- ðŸ‘€ My day job is as a developer. My software interests include cryptography, data compression, 3D graphics (OpenGL/Metal), Open Street Map, robotics, image processing, embedded systems and 3D printing.  I work on iOS/Linux/macOS/Windows using C/C++/ObjC/Perl/Python.
- ðŸŒ± What you'll find here are libraries and utilities I find particularly helpful and Samples of things I'm testing out. Iâ€™m currently learning Swift, and as I get a chance Vulkan and DirectX.
